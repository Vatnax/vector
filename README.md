# vector
# a vector (dynamic array) implementation

A really basic implementation of vector.

### The idea behind this project
_C++ knowledge + unawareness of data structures = making own implementation to better understand the problem_

That's an equation that I've been driven by when making this project.

I obviously knew what a vector is, I was using them everyday. But what always has been bothering me was how they made that. It's a class, isn't it? So how is it implemented? How can I create my own? To answer these questions, I had to at least attempt to make my own vector. Obviously, vector in C++ sense, not the mathematic vector.

### Some technical stuff
This project has been made with C++ and compiled with MS Visual C++ Compiler. The project also makes use of SFINAE concept and iterators.

### Installation

### THIS IS AN OLD PROJECT, THAT'S WHY IT DOESN'T HAVE MANY COMMITS!
